# Stripe on Heroku

A simple three page to take credit card payments:

1. A welcome page with a configurable header/description, that takes a USD
   amount and memo.
2. A confirmation page, showing the amount and memo. With a button to take the
   credit card charge via [Stripe](http://stripe.com).
3. A 'thank you' page with a email link.

Register with stripe and use your [stripe API
keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apikeys) when you click on the link
